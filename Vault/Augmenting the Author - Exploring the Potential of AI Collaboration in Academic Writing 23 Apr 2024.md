## ## Abstracts

### 🧠 **What’s the paper about?**

It explores how **Generative AI (Gen AI)**—specifically **Gemini** and **ChatGPT**—can be used as **==collaborative tools==** in academic writing. The focus is on how researchers and AI can work together, not just how AI writes on its own.

### 🔍 **What did they do?**

- **==Collaborative Inquiry==**: Researchers didn’t just test the AIs—they _worked with them_ in guided sessions.
- **Prompt Design**: They carefully crafted prompts to see how different inputs affect the AI’s responses.
- **Output Analysis**: They studied the AI-generated research outlines to ==evaluate quality and relevance==.

### 📊 **What did they find?**

- **==Prompt variation really matters==**—changing how you ask affects what you get.
- Each AI model (Gemini vs. ChatGPT) has **unique strengths and limitations**.
- Understanding these differences is key to using AI responsibly in academic work.

### 💡 **Why does it matter?**

The study adds to **Human-Computer Interaction (==HCI==)** by:

- Offering strategies for better prompt design.
- Comparing how different Gen AI models perform.
- Encouraging deeper conversations about how AI should be used in scholarly writing.
