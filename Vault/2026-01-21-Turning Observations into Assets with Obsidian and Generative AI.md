## ## Log a worklog into a "Daily Note" and Log a task log into a "Task Note"

### ### What phases We should use Gen AI
1. Take a "BUD" and search an "answer"
	1. HOW we can get an answer smoothly and deeply
2. Make a "ROOT/STEM"
	1. Get and summarize "Common sense of the Domain space" using Gen AI
3. Make a tentative STREAM 
	1. Make a tentative paragraph using own outline to extend with GenAI
	2. Make a slide using GenAI

### ### CAPTURE Phase: Task a "BUD" that has 400 characters
- **KEEP**: Verbalize a triggered "Cognitive Dissonance" from the domain of the real world
	- Q with Gen AI
		- Concerns
		- Surrounding
		- Question (4W4H+3Why)
		- Queries (Prompts)
	- Objective
		- Look over and around the domain space of targeted world.
			- Key concerns
			- Key Points and Points of view
	- KEEPING: Triggered Operation and Command
		- Google Keep
		- Zenn Scrap: Scrap images and surrounding
		- GitHub Issues: Key concerns
		- ChatGPT: Queries
			- Accumulated into Note.com
	- Make Q-Space
		- BE Space
		- HAVE Space
		- BEHAVE (ACT) Space
		- HERE-THERE Space
		- START-FLOW-STOCK-END Space

### ### REFINE Phase: Make a ROOT/STEM and LEAF, such as STRUCT, CLASS, PROTOTYPE, DIAGRAMS that has about 1200 characters, less than 2000 characters.

		- STEM - Scientific, Technical, Engineerable, Mathematical
			- Argument Flow
				- Backing and Theory
			- Process Flow - Procedures
			- PROJECTED STREAM: Value Chaining
				- R: Relative
				- A: Attainable
				- SMART
					- S: Specific
					- M: Measurable
					- T: Time-bounded
### ### REPRESENT Phase: Make a Representation, such Slides and Script
