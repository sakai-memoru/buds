- **QUESTION**:
	- How Should I use Generative AI that are more potential than before for writing an academic argument
		- How to use generative AI, which holds more potential than ever before, in academic writing
	- **ANSWER**
		-  Generative AI is making waves in academic writing, and when used thoughtfully, it can be a powerful current to ride! 🌊 Here’s how to harness its potential while staying academically responsible:
			- Smart ways to use Generative AI in Academic Writing
				- 1. Idea Generation & Brainstorming
					- Explore angles
					- Generate research questions
					- Map out possible structures for my paper
				- 2. Literature Exploration
					- Human must read deeply instead of AI
					- But AI can help summarize articles, suggest related topics, or clarify complex concepts ― great for getting unstack.
				- 3. Drafting & Rewriting
					- Rephrase awkward sentences
					- Improve clarity
					- even generate sample paragraphs based on my outline.
					- ✓ Just be sure to revise and make it my own.
				- 4. Citation Assistant
					- Help format citations
					- Help suggest sources
						- we always have to double-check accuracy and credibility
